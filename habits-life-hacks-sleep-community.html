<p><em>Apparently, I use my friends to help me sleep</em></p>
<p>I reached out to people in sleep communities on facebook and reddit, and asked a couple of open-ended questions: <strong>What technologies/methods do you use to help you sleep at night? What do you wish was better?</strong></p>
<p>The responses were varied and amazing! I’m copying them below for your viewing pleasure, followed by my <strong>analysis at the end:</strong></p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Headspace has changed my life so much. I have had anxiety disorder my entire life. I couldn’t sit through a movie. Had to be moving. Headspace has changed that. I can now fall asleep.</li>
<li>I keep a calming aroma-pillow spray.</li>
<li>Plants have completely changed my home. It feels relaxing, productive, and reminds me to both meditate, exercise and keep a good sleep schedule. So I would recommend plants in the home and the bedroom. I also recommend a strict sleep schedule.</li>
<li>An eyemask for sure! I need it pure dark to sleep so that helps so much. I also have a lamp that I set to fade over 30–45 minutes so that I don’t stay up super late reading. It’s also a wakeup light (starts getting brighter over 30 minutes), which is nice and makes bird sounds which is peaceful to wake to. And I use a bluetooth headband to listen to the [Sleep With Me] podcast.</li>
<li>I use this eye mask / headphone combo and I love it!</li>
<li>I wish I could make a play list of [Sleep With Me podcast] episodes I like and listen to it on my Alexa.</li>
<li>I started listening to the [Sleep With Me] podcast to get away from falling asleep to TV. I like to play this game (two dots) as I’m winding down and starting the podcast. i know screens aren’t great before bed but it calms my mind down and keeps me from scrolling on social media!</li>
<li>I play a good old bubble popping game.</li>
<li>I wish that there were sleep phones with softer speakers.</li>
<li>Lavender linen spray. Dark room. Cold room. Meditative breathing.</li>
<li>Three pairs generic wired sleep phones went to the big farm. Also, I did not like the sound on the bluetooth. I bought these MMUSS replacement wired phones to put in my head bands.</li>
<li>I fall asleep instantly to these Headspace sleepcasts. (They are more visual than the [Sleep With Me] podcast.) Then later I put on an all night Sleep With Me episode.</li>
<li>Fan and a white noise machine in addition to a few hours of Scoots [/Sleep With Me podcast].</li>
<li>Tried a huge array of [sleep] masks including smart ones and fabric ones with specific eye cushions for $30+. Honestly, what has worked for me the best is a simple molded eye cup mask with nothing fancy. The molded eyecups are so that no fabric is touching your eyes/eyelashes as you’re trying to fall asleep. It is the most basic one($4.99) and it has been the most effective. I have one by my bed, in the car(as a passenger), and in my travel kit when I’m on planes and at the airport.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Very interesting responses! Let’s break them down into some categories.</p>
<h3>Problems people deal with:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Anxiety and/or inability to calm the mind.</li>
<li>Inability to stick to regular sleep schedule.</li>
<li>Bedroom not dark enough.</li>
<li>The draw of social media scrolling at night.</li>
<li>Jetlag.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Solutions &amp; hacks people employ:</h3>
<h4>1. Audio:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Podcasts &amp; “sleepcasts” (Sleep With Me or Headspace).</li>
<li>Sleep mask with Bluetooth/wired “soft” headphones.</li>
<li>White noise.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Light:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Timer/smart lamps that fade out at night and up in the morning.</li>
<li>Well fitted sleep mask / dark room.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Smell:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pillow / linen spray (lavender, etc).</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Activity:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Meditation.</li>
<li>Calming smartphone games (bubble popping, etc).</li>
<li>Breathing exercises.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think there is definitely a market here. In any case, I could certainly personally use a solution that helps keep me keep a strong sleep schedule and feel refreshed everyday, given my busy life!</p>
<p>Another interesting thing I noticed is that almost all the respondents were middle-aged women! Perhaps this is a sampling bias because most of them were from facebook, but I’ll keep a lookout to see if this pattern continues in my future research.</p>
